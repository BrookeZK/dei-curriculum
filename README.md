## Epicodus EDI Curriculum

Epicodus is committed to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the tech industry. For that reason, we've made our EDI and other diversity-related curriculum available publicly.

* [diversity-curriculum](https://github.com/epicodus-classroom/edi-curriculum/tree/master/diversity-curriculum) includes all general lessons on EDI in our curriculum. Topics include identifying and preventing microaggressions, addressing implicit bias, understanding stereotype threat, and others.

* [edi-talks] will include content on our weekly EDI talks. This is a work in progress.

We've done our best to compile information and resources here that are helpful to our students, but we don't want to claim that we're experts in EDI. If you have suggestions or concerns, pull requests and issues are welcome!
