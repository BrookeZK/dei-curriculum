## Epicodus Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Curriculum

Epicodus is committed to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion (DEI) in the tech industry. For that reason, we've made our DEI and other diversity-related curriculum available publicly.

* [diversity-curriculum](https://github.com/epicodus-classroom/DEI-curriculum/tree/master/diversity-curriculum) includes all general lessons on DEI in our curriculum. Topics include identifying and preventing microaggressions, addressing implicit bias, understanding stereotype threat, and others. We are gradually moving towards putting this content in our weekly DEI talks.

* [DEI-talks](https://github.com/epicodus-classroom/dei-curriculum/tree/master/dei-talks) includes content on our weekly DEI talks. This is a work in progress. Currently, we are working on content for the first 7 weeks of our program:

  * **Week 1**: Introduction to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Curriculum
  * **Week 2**: Why Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are Important
  * **Week 3**: Identifying and Preventing Microaggressions
  * **Week 4**: Recognizing Privilege
  * **Week 4**: Imposter Syndrome
  * **Week 5**: Asking and Listening
  * **Week 6**: Speaking Up
  * **Week 7**: Building Community

We've done our best to compile information and resources here that are helpful to our students, but we don't want to claim that we're experts in DEI. If you have suggestions or concerns, pull requests and issues are welcome!
