Epicodus is committed to increasing diversity in the tech industry. That means serving students from underrepresented communities and also doing everything we can to increase the representation of these communities in the tech community. This includes people of color, women, LGBTQ, people with disabilities, and other marginalized populations.

As part of our effort towards building a more diverse tech industry, our curriculum includes a weekly **EDI** topic. **EDI** is short for **Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion**. We will cover these terms (and many more) over the next twenty weeks of class. We'll also briefly cover these terms here:

* **Equity**: To define equity, we also have to think about equality. Equality is about treating everyone equally regardless of their background. Equity, on the other hand, means recognizing that everyone's background is different - and that some people will need additional resources to succeed. For instance, someone a person that had regular access to a computer in their home while they were growing up has an advantage over someone that can't afford a computer and grew up without one. We want everyone to succeed at Epicodus, regardless of their background. That means some students will need more resources than others.

* **Diversity**: Traditionally, the tech industry has skewed heavily white and male. Bringing **diversity** to the tech industry means hiring and retaining people of color, women, LGBTQ, people with disabilities, and other marginalized populations.

* **Inclusion**: In order to diversify the tech industry, we need to be **inclusive**. While diversity refers to the traits and characteristics that make us different from one another, inclusion refers to the actions we take to make others feel welcome.

If these definitions seem a bit vague right now, that's okay. We'll be covering them more in depth throughout the course.

As part of your homework each Monday, there will be a short lesson on that week's EDI topic. Then, on Tuesday morning, as part of standup, your instructors will lead a talk on that topic.
