This lesson is part of our regular Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion curriculum. On most Mondays, you will be expected to read a short lesson about that week's DEI topic. Then, on Tuesday, your instructor will lead a standup on that topic.

Last week, we discussed the benefits (including the economic benefits) of diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. This week, we'll discuss why DEI efforts are so important in the tech industry - and elsewhere.

## Equity Versus Equality

When we value equity, it means that we are focused on giving people what they need to be successful.

On the other hand, equality is the idea that we should treat everyone the same no matter what - even if that means some people won't be successful as a result.

However, there's a problem with treating everyone the same. People are born in different situations, with different challenges, and with different opportunities. Linda may grow up in a wealthy family with access to a computer, two parents and good schools. On the other hand, Sally may grow up without access to a computer in a single family household - and may go to schools that don't offer the same opportunity and support. Sally may need some additional tools and support to have a greater chance at success in the tech industry.

Also, there's a simple, sad fact - we have a long way to go, both in the tech industry and in our country, not just on issues of equity but also on basic equality. In the example above, Sally isn't getting equitable _or_ equal opportunity.

Unfortunately, this lack of equality and equity is systemic - it doesn't just affect Sally. It affects entire groups of people. As a result, women, BIPOC, and other groups are still underrepresented in the tech industry - as this [Wired article shows](https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/). Instead, as the charts in this article demonstrate, the industry is predominantly white and male.

## Recognizing Privilege

Why is the industry primarily white and male? There is no compelling evidence to show that white men have an innately better to code and work in the tech industry than other groups.

In the United States, both whites and males have traditionally had more **privilege** than other underrepresented groups in the tech industry - and this trend continues to this day. **Privilege** is an unearned advantage that a group gives to some but not all people.

Anyone can have privilege. For instance, take a look at the chart below, which illustrates different kinds of privilege.

As we can see, there are many different kinds of privilege. In order to have a diverse and equitable tech industry, we need to neutralize this privilege and practice inclusion.
