In an ideal world, we wouldn't have to worry about microaggressions or other hurtful behavior. Unfortunately, we don't live in that ideal world. When we are on the receiving end of - or see someone else on the receiving end of - a microaggression or other hurtful behavior, we need to have tools in place to speak up.

If we wait until the microaggression occurs, we might find ourselves saying something hurtful in return - or pretending it didn't happen even though we might later wish that we'd addressed it in the moment. By thinking about how we'll address these situations ahead of time, we can be better equipped to deal with them when they do happen.

The tools we discuss in this lesson were adapted from and inspired by an AllyShift training hosted by Prosper Portland, an organization dedicated to creating a more equitable city.

When addressing a microaggression or other hurtful behavior, the following approaches can be helpful:

* **Keep your response short, simple, and firm.** Here are some sample responses:

  * "That wasn't funny."
  * "Can you phrase that differently?"
  * "What you just said bothered me."
  * "That makes me uncomfortable."

* **Engage with the other person.** You are under no obligation to engage with someone that behaves in a hurtful way, even if you believe that person was well-intended or didn't mean to be hurtful. However, you may find it helpful to engage with the other person and start a dialogue. Asking an open-ended question can help clarify what was said or done - and also lead to others examining their behaviors more closely. Here are some examples:

  * "What did you mean by that?"
  * "Why do you feel that way?"
  * "Where did you get that information from?"
  * "Can you confirm what you just said?"

Speaking up can be very challenging. If you have been the target of previous microaggressions and hurtful behavior, speaking up can be particularly exhausting. Even if you aren't from a minority group, you may feel that speaking up will put you on the spot or make others feel bad. Don't forget that it's okay to make mistakes - especially if you are willing to learn from them.

The tweet below sums up this process well.

It reads: "PSA: There is no shame in adding that you were previously speaking from a less informed place. There's a lot of info in the world. No one has all of it. We do our best, and at our best, we help each other learn."
