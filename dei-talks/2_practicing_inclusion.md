This lesson is part of our regular Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion curriculum. On most Mondays, you will be expected to read a short lesson about that week's DEI topic. Then, on Tuesday, your instructor will lead a standup on that topic.

Last week, we discussed the benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. This week, we'll demystify the terms diversity, equity, and inclusion. We've already given basic definitions in [Introduction to DEI Talks](link-needed). Here, we'll dive more deeply into this terminology as well as other terms.

## DEI Terminology

* When we value **equity**, it means that we are focused on giving people what they need to be successful.

On the other hand, **equality** is the idea that we should treat everyone the same no matter what - even if that means some people won't be successful as a result.

However, there's a problem with treating everyone the same. People are born in different situations, with different challenges, and with different opportunities. One person may grow up in a wealthy family with access to a computer, two parents and good schools. Another person may grow up without access to a computer in a single family household - and may go to schools that don't offer the same opportunity and support. The second person may need some additional tools and support to have a greater chance at success in the tech industry.

For that reason, we need to focus on equity to ensure that more people get opportunities in the tech industry.

* When we value **diversity**, it means we recognize and acknowledge the difference between people - and see our differences as an asset.
